##Continual Face Expression Edditing

![Face Editing](imgs/network.png)

we explore how continuous emotion
representations can be used to control automated expression
editing. We propose a deep generative model that can be used
to manipulate facial expressions in facial images according
to continuous two-dimensional emotion labels. One dimension
represents an emotionâ€™s valence, the other represents its degree
of arousal.

##Face Editing

![Face Editing](imgs/example.jpg)

The Experiments folder holds our experimental setup routine. Faces are edited using our
proposed network and a range of arousals and valences.

##Trained Network

We provide a trained network that can be evaluated by running the editFaces.py script.
